# Restaurant Page
This project utilises Javascript modules and the Single Page Application (SPA) strategy using vanilla Javascript, HTML and CSS.

The different pages of the website are split into different Javascript modules which generate a DOM section and are called by the main index.js file when the user clicks the corresponding menu button.

The project also utilises some CSS transition properties to create a smoother UX.
